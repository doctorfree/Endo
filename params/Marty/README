	These parameters and the equations they are used in were taken 
	from the book "Symmetry In Chaos" by Michael Field and Martin 
	Golubitsky. When invoked with no arguments, each shell script 
	will produce a histogram of trajectories for the map which, if
	let run long  enough, will resemble the corresponding figure from
	the book. 

	If you invoke any of these scripts with the arguments :
		"-S 0 -n 2 -P 1 -p"
	then you should get a window displaying the critical curves and
	their first couple of iterates. For these maps,  these critical
	curves (where the Jacobian vanishes) usually look pretty cool.

	If you invoke a  script with the arguments :
		"-S 0 -p"
	then you will see the rate of attraction displayed in a window.
